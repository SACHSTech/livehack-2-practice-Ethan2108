A right-angled triangle has the property that when the values of the lengths of the sides are squared, the sum of the two smaller values is equal to the larger value. For example, 12, 5, and 13 make a right-angled triangle, because 12 * 12 = 144, 5 * 5 = 25, 13 * 13 = 169, and 144 + 25 = 169.

Write a program that asks the user to enter three values and then determines whether the triangle created is a right-angled triangle or not.  Do not assume that the sides are entered in order of smallest to greatest.  (i.e you donâ€™t prompt them to enter the hypotenuse).


1. Create a flowchart of a solution to the problem.

2. Create the program in python

### Example Run
```
Enter the length of side 1: 12
Enter the length of side 2: 5
Enter the length of side 3: 13

The triangle with side lengths 12, 5, and 13 form a right-angled triangle.
```

## problem2.py


You have been working really hard at school and you're thinking about taking a summer vacation. You've discussed your thoughts with your parents and they told you that you can go away to Europe if you achieve an average 80% or greater and earn $500 before the summer.  If you do not earn $500 but still achieve an average 80% or over, you can go to California.  If you cannot achieve at least 80%, you don't get to go away.

1. Create a Flowchart for the above scenario.  Inputs should be your `mark` and `earnings before the summer`.  Be sure that it is labelled appropriately and uses the proper shapes.

2. Write the python code for a program based on the above scenario.  Include the proper output statements that indicate what you will be doing this summer
